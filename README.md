# Filter editor for Median XL #

This tool allows editing filter structure outside of Median XL (an overhaul mod for Diablo 2).

Current item/class data: MXL 2.10.3

### Features:
- Easier rule editing/reordering
- More extensive item code list than the one in-game
- Saving/loading filters in localStorage


### TODO:
- Fill in scroll of enchantment data
- Add working search bar for table data
- Rule verification (so that an impossible rule cannot be created)
- Different styling for inactive rules
