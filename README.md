# Median XL Filter editor #

This tool allows for creating and modifying filters outside of Median XL (an overhaul mod for Diablo 2).

Current item/class data: MXL 2.10.3

### Features:
- Easier rule editing/reordering
- More extensive item code list than the one in-game (specific Cycles, Scrolls, Mystic Orbs)
- Saving/loading filters in localStorage

### TODO:
- Optimize select2 data loading (current is very slow when loading large amount of rules)
- Add working search bar for table data
- Rule verification (so that an impossible rule cannot be created)
- Different styling for inactive rules
