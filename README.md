# Median XL Filter editor #

This tool allows for creating and modifying filters outside of Median XL (an overhaul mod for Diablo 2).

Current item/class data: MXL 2.10.3

### Features:
- Easier rule editing/reordering
- More extensive item code list than the one in-game (specific Cycles, Scrolls, Mystic Orbs)
- Saving/loading filters in localStorage
- Searching for items that match specific category eg. "Quest item" (categories pulled from game data)
- Defining default values for rules (chat notify, map display)

### TODO:
- Different styling for inactive rules
